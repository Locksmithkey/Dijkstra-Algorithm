Problem: Finding the smallest weight between from a starting vertex

Client file uses Dijkstra's algorithm to determine shortest path beteen each city from start
uses the Graph class to create a directed graph of vertices along with their edge weights. 

Client file also takes in external file data to populate  the vector and graph.

Using a vector of structs that hold vertex data such at the name, weight, mark status, and previous visited 
vertex to circumnavigate though the graph and find each shortest distance.

The cities are added via the AddVertex method in the Graph class along with AddEdge to decalre the distance between two cites.

It also uses a GetToVertices method that queues up a input city's adjecent city based on the direction in the graph.

For finding the shortest path from V1 in ginfile2.dat.

once all origins, destinations, and distances are sorted in a containter; V1 is provided as a start vertex and its adjecent vertex
are fed into the queue via GetToVertices. Then the function finds the first unvisited node that current distance is less than the
weight between the two cities. In this case, it's V2. V2 is marked as visited and total weight is updated in the struct, along with
its previous being V1. The FindMin and UpdateVertex funtions are called again until every vertex has been visited with their correct
weights added.
